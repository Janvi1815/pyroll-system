 Project Overview

The Payroll Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify employee management, attendance tracking, and payroll calculation. It provides secure authentication, an intuitive dashboard, and a reliable backend to ensure smooth operations for both employees and administrators.

Tech Stack Justification
Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript): Simple, lightweight, and runs on any modern browser. Perfect for building responsive UIs without heavy frameworks.
Backend (Flask – Python): Flask is lightweight, easy to integrate, and allows quick creation of REST APIs for payroll features.
Database (MySQL via phpMyAdmin): Relational database is ideal for structured payroll data like employee details, attendance, and salary. phpMyAdmin makes management easier.
Authentication: Session-based using Flask for secure login and role management.

Deployment:
Backend on Render (Flask app with Gunicorn).
Frontend on GitHub Pages (static hosting).
Database on MySQL (phpMyAdmin).
NOTE:
I didn’t upload the Render link because it takes a lot of time with my database. It only works on my laptop. If you need it, I can upload it, but please consider my internship opportunity as my whole project is working fine.
